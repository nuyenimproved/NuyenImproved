				The player is expected to be fairly open about their allegiances; visible tattoos are a common choice. Whether this presents an advantage or disadvantage in a given situation is up to the GM; it is expected that a known and favored member of a Syndicate will face greater fear, respect, admiration and revulsion than the average criminal or runner.

			<notes>This quality can only be taken by Valkyries. These wings give the Valkyrie a flying speed of 2/6/+2. This character requires metahuman adjustment to properly use vehicles without a -1 like Dwarves and Elves.</notes>

			<notes>This quality can only be taken by Pixies. Pixies can only use weapons that could normally be used one handed (i.e. Knives, Short Swords, Small Axes, Clubs, Batons, Maces with the exception of the Osmium Maces, Whips, Chakrams, Shields, Grenades, Pistols, SMGs, and Bows) but that have to two hand these weapons. So they treat these weapons like two handed weapons for them, needing Iaijutsu to quickdraw the blades and treating the holsters for the guns as slings. In addition, they raise the concealability of all of their items and weapons by +6 for the purposes of trying to palm them and hide them on their person.</notes>

			<notes>This quality can only be taken by Dalakitnon. This allows the Dalakitnon to change their appearance to a different gender version of themselves over the course of a minute. This transformation requires concentration and makes them look like a version of themselves as the gender identity they choose to express but does not make them magically shape shift into another person. An outsider may confuse them with a sibling or family member of the gender expression they were familiar with if they met the Dalakitnon while they take a different form.</notes>
